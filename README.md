# P7 - Develop the back-end of a book rating site

For this educational project, in my role as a front-end developer, I was tasked with creating the front-end of the website. Specifically, I focused on developing the work presentation page, building the administrator login page from scratch, and integrating the modal for uploading new works, all starting from the ground up.

The project constraints dictated the use of vanilla JavaScript for dynamically retrieving existing works from the backend. To achieve this, I employed Fetch API calls, integrating various filters for the gallery. Subsequently, I developed the login page, adhering to the mockup while implementing user authentication. Lastly, I coded the work addition modal, incorporating functionalities to add, delete, and modify works with interactions handled on the backend.
